The command `clockify-cli show` can check if a clockify task is running. So, how can I use that command to remind me that I'm not doing something with a tracking task?

- I can use a command that checks every X minutes for a running clockify taks, if a task is not setup it spits a notification.
- I can modify some of my scripts to not work unless I have a task running
- I can modify some scripts to start the clocky reminder 
- Could I make it a vim notification?
