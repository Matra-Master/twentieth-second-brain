## Getting Started

So how do you get this template to work for your project? It is easier than you think.

### Requirements

* A bag of holding

### Install

Use this command to start installing

```

```

### Usage

Use the well known command to start your ordeal

```bash
```


## Don't forget anything

Think hard about anything that is clear to you but might not be clear for others. Why are you using this aproach or why did you pick this solution instead?

### Used technologies

For sure mention all the technologies you used. If the technologies age in time you don't forget
they are used and need to be replaced.

### Testing

No tests no sucess. You SHOULD have tests for every project, but do new users know how to run them?
