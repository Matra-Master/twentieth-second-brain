What will you discover today?

There are three pitfalls that lead to poor speech articulation:

- My speech is limited by my poor _surface lexicon_ (the 1.5K words I use most commonly to speak)
- There exist dead phrases, figures of speech or prepackaged snippets of dialog that we tend to use in an effort of not having to detail an idea with missing words. They serve general purposes but are so overused that feel vague and inconclusive.
- Not being able of retaining an idea in your mind during speech. An effective and articulate orator can peel an idea layer by layer without sidetracking or losing focus.

If you check the sources of speech you expose yourself daily you can get a great idea of where your words come from:

| Source                | INT(1-10) |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| Youtube entertainment |           |
| Youtube education     |           |
| Friends               |           |
| -Work                 |           |
| -College              |           |
| Music/Spotify         |           |
| Movies/Series         |           |
| Social Media          |           |
| Messages              |           |
| Family                |           |
| Soliloquy             |           |

### TIP: Repeat the question aloud

The act of repeating the question yourself is the act of introducing the question into your mind for processing

My speech weaknesses are: I need more time to think before answering than most people, I tend to not have strong opinions or opinions at all in most topics, and also I tend to not understand questions right.

### 6 Rules for articulacy in speech:

1. Articulacy increases when you practice concious selection with your words. (Prefer homemade)
2. Effortless articulacy is limited to the size of your surface lexicon. (Grow, expand, explode)
3. The longer you engage a thought the greater depth you achieve with words. (Retain thoughts through speech)
4. The quality of your speech is a product of your language environment. (You are what you eat)
5. Sentences sound articulate when words flow into eloquent molds. (It's all about beign eloquent)
6. An admission of limitations is often the most articulate answer. (Be forward communicating your limits)
