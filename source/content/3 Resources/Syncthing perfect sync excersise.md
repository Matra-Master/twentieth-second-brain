How can I keep a good sync balance between my 4/5 devices?
- **Plus Ultra**
- E2
- Elster
- W11 desktop
- **Cirilla Server**

**The main sync devices should be my server and the cellphone**

List of folders usually synced:
- Dotfiles
- Notes
- Worknotes
- Wallpapers
- Random passes (somewhere to throw a file to another device, not to be kept in sync for too long)
-
