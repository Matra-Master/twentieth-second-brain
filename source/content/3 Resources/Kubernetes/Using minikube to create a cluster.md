# K8s definitions

**Control Plane.** It's the virtual space or machine host responsible of managing the cluster.
**Cluster.** The abstract group formed by all the k8s machines (virtual or not).
**Node.** One of the worker machines associated to a cluster that run apps. The bees to our hive.
**Node Process.** An app or work order running inside a Node.
**Deployment.** 
**Service.** 


## Useful remarks

- A production ready cluster should have a minimum of three working nodes at any time.
- A cluster can be deployed on either physical or virtual machines.
- Minikube is a lightweight k8s implementation that makes a VM in your local machine.
