An example roadmap from _The Primeagen_

### Exploration/Documentation stage

Do some advent of code or some simple katas and excercises to learn things like basic types and file manipulations; errors, control structures and stuff.

### Projects

#### Websocket server

Chatroom client that takes connections
Join - string
Leave - string
Send message - string

What does the API provides? Are there Libraries? How do you handle async and modules?

#### Find my own personal big project

Primeagen used the book "How to build an interpreter" and actually built an interpreter in Typescript, Rust and then Zig o.o
I would like to make a simple pokemon battler or a Duel monster thing maybe.
