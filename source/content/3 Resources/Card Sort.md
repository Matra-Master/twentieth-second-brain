# Card Sort

Simple method used to get insight from users about the optimal way of organizing categories and items into groups. It helps in Information Arquitecture and UX analisis through testing the mental models of test subjects.

Consists in a bunch of cards with names in them. The person must arrange them in labeled groups.
The two main forms are Closed CS and Open CS. Closed uses a predefined set of groups, and open leaves them to the test subject.
