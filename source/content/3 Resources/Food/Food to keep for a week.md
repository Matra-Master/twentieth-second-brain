## Plan
**1. Grocery essentials:** make a list of everything you need to buy. Not including what you already have
**2. Prep Basics:** these are the building blocks, the things you will use through the week to assemble meals
**3. Building the actual meals:** the actual techniques and fast preparations. Maybe an orientative list of assembled meals or techniques. (Maybe the dice table ðŸ‘€)
